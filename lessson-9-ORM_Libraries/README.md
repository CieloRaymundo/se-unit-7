- How does an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) work?
- What are the benefits and downsides of using an ORM when creating applications?

**Learning Assignments**
_NOTE: Most of these assignments contain instructions necessary to set up your machine OR documentation for you to skim and bookmark before moving onto the project. There will be other assignments embedded into the coding exercise instructions._

- [Why Use Sequelize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Kq9uHhT_k) is an important question engineers must ask. Watch this 8 minute video to gain a solid overview of why Sequelize is used to communicate to the database from an Express server.
- Read the [Sequelize Guides](https://sequelize-guides.netlify.com/getting-started/) to get a snapshot of how to utilize the ORM.
- [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) so that you can later ensure your API is retrieving and returning data correctly. Feel free to watch the [Postman Installation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5n07Ybz7yI).
- Bookmark the [JQuery Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/) for later use in your project.

**Practice**

- Follow instructions in the [instructions markdown file](practice/coding-exercise-instructions.md)
- Complete the coding exercise within the [coding-exercise directory](practice/coding-exercise)
