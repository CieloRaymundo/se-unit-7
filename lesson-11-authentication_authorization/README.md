# Lesson 7.6 - Notes

## Authorization and Authentication

### Key Terms:

- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
- OAuth
- Confidential Client
- Public Client
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Tokens
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Sessions
- Cookies

### Essential Questions:

1. What are the top 10 security risks for web applications?
2. How can engineering teams defend against security risks?
3. How do confidential and public clients differ?

### Learning Assignments:

1. Learn about the [top 10 application security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) from the experts at OWASP.
2. Get a high level overview of OAuth and why it is important by watching this [5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT8ybowdyr0).
3. Dive deeper into the resources [OAuth resources](https://oauth.net/2/) and get a closer look at tools used to secure applications:
   - [Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
   - [Web Authentication](https://oauth.net/webauthn/)
   - [Tokens](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/)
   - [JSON Web Tokens/JWT](https://oauth.net/2/jwt/)
   - [OPTIONAL: Videos](https://oauth.net/videos/)

### Practice:

The practice exercises will push your understanding of full stack web applications. The goal is to understand some of the most common security risks and how to defend applications against those risks as an engineer.
