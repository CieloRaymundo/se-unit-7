# Practice Exercises 7.2

1. Given everything you have learned so far, how might we use a front-end framework in conjunction with our back-end applications? Why might we want to build this way?

2. What is the purpose of the Express framework? How does it make our lives easier?

3. Describe the flow of middleware in a web application. **NOTE**: Maybe add some notes about templating here...

4. Build a basic route using a get request

5. Build a basic route responding to a POST request

6. Use input from the user from a query string and from form data

6. Build a route that redirects to another route

7. Build a Caesar Cipher application - your app should responds to a post request and should funciton as follows: Return your respone as a JSON object with a key of the input and a value of the output.

8. Update your controller function to respond to two different types of requests. If the request if for JSON, keep returning the JSON you've already setup. If your request is for HTML, then respond with an HTML template that looks as follows:

<!-- 4. Using Express, write an application that responds to the `/dogs/:id` route with JSON. For this exercise, use the object in `fakeDB` as a fake database. If the dog with that ID exists, we should render JSON with the dog's given information. Otherwise, we should respond with a 404 and an error message.

5. Using Express, write an application that renders a template for that given dog.

6. What are the advantages of using the `express-generator`? When might you want to do this? -->
